# Climate Visualization App

![Climate Visualization](image.png)

## Project Overview

This project is a Shiny web application designed for interactive climate data visualization. It allows users to explore various climate variables, including:

- **TAVG** (Average Temperature)
- **TMAX** (Maximum Temperature)
- **TMIN** (Minimum Temperature)
- **PRCP** (Precipitation)

The application provides two main types of analysis:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize the selected climate variable over time, with a fitted linear trend and anomaly detection (points that deviate significantly from the trend).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore the relationship between two selected climate variables, with a linear regression trend line to highlight patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Global Summary of the Month** dataset, which provides monthly weather summaries. The dataset includes important attributes such as temperature and precipitation levels for specific regions. The dataset was sourced from NOAAâ€™s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

The `DATE` field was formatted from `YYYY-MM` into a proper date format for the analysis, and missing values were handled as appropriate during data filtering.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can filter data based on date range and specific regions.
- **Trend Detection**: Time series plots include a linear regression line to show trends over time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: The app flags anomalies (data points beyond two standard deviations) in the time series.
- **Dynamic Plotting**: Uses `ggplot2` for static plots and `plotly` for interactive visualizations, allowing zooming and hovering over data points.
- **Faceted Plots**: Visualize data trends across different regions by using faceted plots.

## Technology Stack

- **R**: Primary language used for building the app.
- **Shiny**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **ggplot2**: For generating static data visualizations.
- **plotly**: For transforming static plots into interactive visualizations.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation and filtering.
- **lubridate**: For handling date formats and working with time series data.

## How to Run the App

1. Install the necessary R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "plotly", "lubridate"))
   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Shiny app using the following command:
   ```
   Rscript climate_visualization.R
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of R's Shiny framework combined with interactive visualizations to explore complex climate datasets. The app provides a flexible and user-friendly interface for analyzing climate trends, correlations between variables, and detecting anomalies across different regions.
